# C-Ray-Tracer-

A C-based ray tracing renderer for visualizing 3D scenes. 
This project generates high-quality rendered images by simulating light and its interactions with objects in a virtual scene.

Features

1. Ray-Sphere Intersection: Calculates pixel colors based on ray-sphere intersection algorithms.

2. Camera & Viewport System: Shoots rays from a fixed camera and maps them to a 2D image space.

3. Memory Management: Dynamically stores multiple spheres with varying positions, radii, and colors.

4. Shading & Lighting: Integrates light sources for realistic shading and background color handling.

5. Linear Algebra: Applies vector math to detect intersections and render accurate 3D images.

Technologies Used

1. C: Core programming language.

2. Linear Algebra: For ray-sphere intersection and rendering.

3. RGB & HEX: Color handling for shading.
