# C-Ray-Tracer-

A C-based ray tracing renderer for visualizing 3D scenes. 
This project generates high-quality rendered images by simulating light and its interactions with objects in a virtual scene.

Features
Ray-Sphere Intersection: Calculates pixel colors based on ray-sphere intersection algorithms.

Camera & Viewport System: Shoots rays from a fixed camera and maps them to a 2D image space.

Memory Management: Dynamically stores multiple spheres with varying positions, radii, and colors.

Shading & Lighting: Integrates light sources for realistic shading and background color handling.

Linear Algebra: Applies vector math to detect intersections and render accurate 3D images.

Technologies Used

C: Core programming language.

Linear Algebra: For ray-sphere intersection and rendering.

RGB & HEX: Color handling for shading.
